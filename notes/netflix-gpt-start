npx create-react-app netflix-gpt

This command will give us properly configured bundler (webpack in this case) , testing environment , folder structure and many things for us to start developing without configuring things on our own.

Let us setup our project.
We will use tailwindcss in our project , so let's stup tailwindcss in our project.

Follow steps of this website - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app

We have configured TailwindCSS successfully.

Let's observe netflix website and plan our website layout.

  We have setup our basic header , login , body , browse components.

  Now let's setup their Routing.

  const Body = () => {

    const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
        {
          path: '/',
          element : <Login />
        },
        {
          path : '/browse',
          element : <Browse />
        }
      ])


  return (
    <div>
        <RouterProvider router={appRouter}/>
    </div>
  )
}

We have also added links to netflix background and netflix logo in login and header components respectively.

const Login = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <div>
        <img alt='Logo'
        src='https://assets.nflxext.com/ffe/siteui/vlv3/fc164b4b-f085-44ee-bb7f-ec7df8539eff/d23a1608-7d90-4da1-93d6-bae2fe60a69b/IN-en-20230814-popsignuptwoweeks-perspective_alpha_website_large.jpg'
        />
      </div>
      
    </div>
  )
}

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <div className='absolute px-8 py-2 bg-gradient-to-b from-black'>
 
       <img 
       className='w-44'
       src='https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dd6b162f-1a32-456a-9cfe-897231c7763c/4345ea78-053c-46d2-b11e-09adaef973dc/Netflix_Logo_PMS.png'
       alt = 'Logo'
       />


    </div>
  )
}


Now , we have created a Sign In form in Login component. We also want to create a sign Up form for new users , challenge is can we use the same form for both sign in and sign up??

On click on 'sign up Now' , we must change the form to sign up form.

we can do that by using state variable to change the form to sign up on click of 'sign up Now'.


Now we have built sign In and Sign up form with the same form using state variable.

How do we validate the fields of the form? How to validate if we have lots of fields in our form?

We can use FORMIK library to build forms with lots of fields and validations for those fields.

In this project, we are writting validations on our own
